	I am a technology enthusiast with a strong background in software development. 
	I am seeking career opportunities that offer challenge, career growth, and a good life-work balance. 
	I'm excited about the future of mobile and networked technologies in this increasingly connected world we now live in.

<p>
	I graduated with honors from the BCIT Computer Systems Technology diploma program in May 2015. 
	The skills and experience I gained there were a first step onto an exciting new career path that I hope will continue to keep me learning.

	I have worked in software development for the past 10 years. I have spent the past year (2015 - 2016) working on a central Build Automation team at Electronic Arts. 
	For 8 years prior to attending BCIT I worked as a Quality Assurance expert in various capacities on a number of shipped AAA game titles.
