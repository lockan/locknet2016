	I am a technology enthusiast with a strong background in software development. 
	I am seeking career opportunities that offer challenge, career growth, and an good life-work balance. 
	I'm excited about the future of mobile and networked technologies in this increasingly connected world we now live in.

	I'll be graduating the BCIT Computer Systems Technology diploma program in May 2015.
